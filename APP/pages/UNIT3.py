        **Employment** refers to the number of employees, including both full-time and part-time workers. 
        **New hires** refers to the number of employees who have recently been recruited and started working at the firm.
        **Separations** refers to the number of employees who leave the firm, either voluntarily (quitting, retiring) 
        or involuntarily (layoffs, dismissals). In addition to **employment**, **new hires**, and **separations**, 
        there are other critical aspects that affect recruitment in a firm: job vacancies (or job openings) and job postings (or job advertisements, or job ads). 
        **Job vacancies (job openings)** represent the number of available positions at the firm for which the firm is actively seeking candidates. 
        **Job postings (job advertisements, job ads)** are advertisements made by the firm to fill open positions, specifying required qualifications and job responsibilities.

        In recruiting, **asymmetric information** arises when candidates know more about their abilities than the firm. 
    This can lead to **adverse selection**, where the firm might hire less qualified candidates because it lacks full information. 
    To mitigate this, candidates use **signaling** (e.g., qualifications, experience) to indicate their abilities, while firms engage 
    in **screening** (e.g., interviews, tests) to gather more information. Additionally, firms often use **probation periods** to assess 
    an employeeâ€™s true performance before making long-term commitments, reducing the risks of hiring based on incomplete information.
