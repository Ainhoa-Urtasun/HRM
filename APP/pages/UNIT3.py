        In recruiting, **asymmetric information** arises when candidates know more about their abilities than the firm. 
    This can lead to **adverse selection**, where the firm might hire less qualified candidates because it lacks full information. 
    To mitigate this, candidates use **signaling** (e.g., qualifications, experience) to indicate their abilities, while firms engage 
    in **screening** (e.g., interviews, tests) to gather more information. Additionally, firms often use **probation periods** to assess 
    an employeeâ€™s true performance before making long-term commitments, reducing the risks of hiring based on incomplete information.
