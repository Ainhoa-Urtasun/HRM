        Employee performance evaluation assesses how effectively employees perform their jobs within the firm. 
        Employee performance can be evaluated in two ways:
        - **On average**: Labor productivity and unit labor cost (ULC) are average measures of employee performance
        across the workforce
        - **Individually**: Output elasticity of effort and the skill gap are individual measures that 
        assess each employee's specific contribution and capabilities
        
        In the context of employee performance evaluation, it is helpful to distinguish between:
        - **The extensive margin**: This evaluates employee participation in tasks, with metrics like
        attendance and absenteeism providing insight into employee engagement and motivation.
        - **The intensive margin**: This evaluates the level of effort and productivity during tasks, focusing on
        how employees perform while working. Examples include labor productivity,
        ULC, output elasticity of labor, and the skill gap.

        between $s_{(k)}$, the **skill requirements** for the job employee $i$ performs, and $s_i$, the 
        **skill profile** of employee $i$. The greater the skill gap, the higher the

        We can analyze the properties of the cost of effort function

    st.write(
        '''
        This first derivative shows the marginal cost of effort. Since $g_i>0$, 
        the marginal cost of effort increases linearly with $e_i$.

        The second derivative with respect to $e_i$ is:

        C''(e_i) = 2 g_i

    st.write(
        '''
        Since $g_i>0$, the second derivative is positive, which means that the cost function
        $C(e_i)$ is convex, or "concave-up". This convexity indicates that the cost of effort 
        increases at an increasing rate as effort $e_i$ rises.
    
        **Jensen's inequality** tells us that for a convex function such as $C(e_i)$, the expected cost of 
        effort is at least the cost of the expected effort. Mathematically:
        '''

    st.latex(
        r'''
        E[C(e_i)] \geq C(E[e_i])
        '''
    )

    st.write(
        '''
        This inequality implies that, due to the convex nature of $C(e_i)$, 
        any variability in effort will lead to a higher average cost compared to a 
        scenario where effort is consistent. Thus, encouraging consistent effort across employees 
        minimizes the cost impact due to the convexity of the function.
