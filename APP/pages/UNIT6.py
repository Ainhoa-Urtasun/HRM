        Firms have two options for skill development (or upskilling): 
        
        1. Hiring new employees
        2. Training incumbent employees
        
        Upskilling may be necesary to adopt new technologies, such as

        On-the-job training aims to provide employees with the 
        skills and competencies needed to complete tasks more efficiently. In other words,     
        on-the-job training aims to reduce the skill gap $g_i$.
        By minimizing $g_i$, the cost of effort for the employee decreases, which can
        positively impact their motivation.

        intervention. We use ATT for assessing the impact of on-the-job training on employees. 

        The difference-in-differences method makes two comparisons: 
        (1) Before and after training: Training occurs at time 0, âˆ’1 refers to the before the training and 
        +1 after the training;
        (2) Trained versus non-trained employees: $g^{trained}$ refers to the average skill gap of a group of employees who received the training; and 
        $g^{non-trained}$ refers to the average skill gap of a group of employees who didn't receive any training.
