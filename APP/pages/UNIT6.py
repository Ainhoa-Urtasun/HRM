        Firms have two options for skill development (or upskilling): 
        
        1. Hiring new employees
        2. Training incumbent employees
        
        Upskilling may be necesary to adopt new technologies, such as 
        robots and artificial intelligence (AI).

        On-the-job training aims to provide employees with the 
        skills and competencies needed to complete tasks more efficiently. In other words,     
        on-the-job training aims to reduce the skill gap $g_i$.
        By minimizing $g_i$, the cost of effort for the employee decreases, which can
        positively impact their motivation.

        intervention specifically on the population exposed to it, providing a clearer isolation of the effect within the treated group.

        In our case, on-the-job training serves as our treatment (or intervention). Training occurs at time 0, with âˆ’1 representing the period before training and 
        +1 the period after training. For accurate application of the DiD technique, we compare two employees with similar characteristics: 
        one who receives the training and one who does not. The Difference-in-Differences approach makes two primary comparisons: 
        (1) the periods before and after training, and (2) trained versus non-trained employees. 
        Combining these comparisons offers a robust method to infer counterfactuals and estimate causal effects accurately.
