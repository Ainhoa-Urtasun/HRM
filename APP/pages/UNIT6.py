        Here we focus on on-the-job training, specifically on evaluating its effectiveness.

        Training programs are designed to enhance employees' skills. Training aims at providing employees with
        the necessary skills to perform their tasks more efficiently

        Employee $i$ exerts effort $e_i$ to successfuly carry out tasks. Effort includes factors such as time, 
        willingness, involvement, and character. 
        Effort is costly, but on-the-job training aims to provide employees with the necessary 
        skills and competencies to complete tasks more efficiently, thereby reducing the cost of effort. 
        This reduction can enhance employee motivation, which in turn aligns with and positively impacts 
        the firmâ€™s overall objectives.

    where \(e\) represents employee effort. Although we typically refer to effort at the employee-task level, \(e_{ij}\), we omit the subscript here for simplicity. Training occurs at time \(0\), so \(-1\) refers to the period before training, and \(+1\) refers to the period after training. This technique makes two comparisons: (1) before vs. after training, and (2) trained vs. non-trained employees. The combination of both comparisons offers a robust method to infer counterfactuals and determine causal effects.
