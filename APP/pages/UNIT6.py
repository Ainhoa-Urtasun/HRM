        Firms have two options for skill development (or upskilling): 
        
        1. Hiring new employees
        2. Training incumbent employees
        
        Upskilling may be necesary to adopt new technologies, such as 
        robots and artificial intelligence (AI).

        Here we focus on on-the-job training.

        between $s_{(k)}$, the vector of skill norms required by the job employee $i$ must perform, and the 
        vector of skills that employee $i$ actually possesses. The greater the distance, the higher the 
        cost of effort for the employee $i$. Remember, the vector of skill norms is derived from 
        the job evaluation process.
        
        On-the-job training aims to provide employees with the necessary 
        skills and competencies to complete tasks more efficiently, thereby reducing the cost of effort. 
        This reduction can enhance employee motivation, which in turn aligns with and positively impacts 
        the firmâ€™s overall objectives.
