        Firms have two options for skill development (or upskilling): 
        
        1. Hiring new employees
        2. Training incumbent employees
        
        Upskilling may be necesary to adopt new technologies, such as 
        robots and artificial intelligence (AI).

        On-the-job training aims to provide employees with the 
        skills and competencies needed to complete tasks more efficiently. In other words,     
        on-the-job training aims to reduce the skill gap $g_i$.
        By minimizing $g_i$, the cost of effort for the employee decreases, which can
        positively impact their motivation.

        Here, **ATT** stands for the **Average Treatment Effect on the Treated**. This metric captures 
        the effect of training on employees who received it (trained group), 
        compared to a similar group that did not receive the training (non-trained group). 

        The Difference-in-Differences (DiD) method achieves this by making two key comparisons:
        
        - **Before and after training**: Training occurs at time 0, so âˆ’1 represents the period before training, and +1 represents the period after training.
        - **Trained versus non-trained employees**: $g^{trained}$ denotes the average skill gap of employees who received training,
        while $g^{non-trained}$ denotes the average skill gap of employees who did not.

        By combining these two comparisons, the DiD method helps estimate the causal impact of training on reducing the skill gap. 
        Note: The method is valid if the **parallel trends assumption** holdsâ€”that is, if the trained and non-trained groups 
        would have followed similar skill gap trends in the absence of training.
