        When a firm needs new skills, it has two primary options: 
        it can acquire them from the labor market by hiring new workers, 
        or it can provide on-the-job training to its existing employees.

        Hiring brings in fresh expertise and potentially diverse perspectives, 
        while training incumbents can enhance skills without disrupting established 
        organizational knowledge and culture. Both approaches have trade-offs in cost, 
        time, and impact on the current workforce.

        Employees receive on-the-job training to improve their performance. 
        Training programs are designed to enhance employees' skills. By focusing on skill development, 
        HR managers ensure that employees acquire the necessary competencies to perform their tasks more efficiently 
        and contribute to the overall success of the organization.
        
        Employee $i$ exerts effort $e_i$ to successfuly carry out tasks. Effort includes factors such as time, 
        willingness, involvement, and character. 
        Effort is costly, but on-the-job training aims to provide employees with the necessary 
        skills and competencies to complete tasks more efficiently, thereby reducing the cost of effort. 
        This reduction can enhance employee motivation, which in turn aligns with and positively impacts 
        the firmâ€™s overall objectives.
    
        We use the **difference-in-differences (DiD) method** to evaluate the impact of training:

    where \(e\) represents employee effort. Although we typically refer to effort at the employee-task level, \(e_{ij}\), we omit the subscript here for simplicity. Training occurs at time \(0\), so \(-1\) refers to the period before training, and \(+1\) refers to the period after training. This technique makes two comparisons: (1) before vs. after training, and (2) trained vs. non-trained employees. The combination of both comparisons offers a robust method to infer counterfactuals and determine causal effects.
