        Firms have two options for skill development (or upskilling): 
        
        1. Hiring new employees
        2. Training incumbent employees
        
        Upskilling may be necesary to adopt new technologies, such as 
        robots and artificial intelligence (AI).

        Here we focus on on-the-job training.
        Given the cost of effort for each employee:

        Where $e_i$ is the effort exerted by employee $i$ and $S_i$ represents a skill

        development of $S_i$.

        Employee $i$ exerts effort $e_i$ to successfuly carry out tasks. Effort includes factors such as time, 
        willingness, involvement, and character. 
        Effort is costly, but on-the-job training aims to provide employees with the necessary 
        skills and competencies to complete tasks more efficiently, thereby reducing the cost of effort. 
        This reduction can enhance employee motivation, which in turn aligns with and positively impacts 
        the firmâ€™s overall objectives.
