        Any firm, regardless of its size, structure, or legal form of ownership, 
        produces an **output** (good or service) and performs **economic activities** 
        to achieve this. Firms are classified into sectors (industries) based on the output 
        they produce and the economic activities they perform. There are standard classifications for
        firms into industries depending on the economic activities they perform.
        In this course, we use **NACE rev. 2, the European Classification of Economic Activities**.

        To perform these economic activities, firms decide which technologies to adopt
        and which jobs to post in the labor market. A job consists of a bundle of tasks, 
        and just as firms are classified into sectors (industries), 
        jobs are classified into occupations based on the tasks they entail. 
        A job is not the same as an occupation. Occupations are standardized, while jobs are more
        flexible as they are designed by firms.

        As there are standard classifications for firms into sectors,
        there are also standard classifications for jobs into occupations, 
        such as **ISCO** that stands for **International Standard Classification 
        of Occupations**.

        - **Employee Performance Evaluation** (UNIT 4): Addresses the intensive margin.
        - **Recruitment** (UNIT 5): Discusses employment, asymmetric information, adverse selection, and how to mitage it.

        - **Compensation** (UNIT 7): Explores pay-for-performance models and employee-ownership options.
        - **Career Development** (UNIT 8): Introduces the tournament model as a framework for employee growth and progression.

        This notation focuses on evaluating employee performance at the intensive margin
