        When an employee is compensated through pay-for-performance, her utility function is expressed as:

        This result shows that the optimal effort level $e_i^*$ increases with the pay rate $w$ and decreases with the cost factor $g_i$. 
        In other words, a higher pay rate motivates more effort, whereas a higher cost of effort discourages it. This represents the supply of effort.

        When an employee receives pay-for-performance with a share of the production output, their utility function includes both their base pay and a portion of the output they help produce.
        The utility function for an employee $i$ can be represented as:

        - $Q$ is the production function representing total output as a function of the efforts of all employees
        - $g_i$ denotes the skill gap of employee $i$

        To determine the optimal level of effort, the employee maximizes their utility by choosing $e_i$
        such that the derivative of their utility with respect to effort is zero. 
        This derivative gives us the **supply of effort** considering both the pay and ownership share.

        Conversely, a higher cost of effort $d_i$ discourages effort, balancing the incentives.
