        When an employee receives pay-for-performance with a share of the production output, their utility function includes both their base pay and a portion of the output they help produce.

    st.latex(

        - $w$ is the rate of pay per unit of effort,

        - $b$ is the employeeâ€™s ownership share in the production output,
        - $f(e_1, e_2, \dots)$ is the production function representing total output as a function of the efforts of all employees,
        - $C(e_i)$ is the cost of effort, typically $C(e_i) = d_i e_i^2$, where $d_i$ reflects the costliness of exerting effort for the employee.

        To determine the optimal level of effort, the employee maximizes their utility by choosing \( e_i \) such that the derivative of their utility with respect to effort is zero. This derivative gives us the **supply of effort** considering both the pay and ownership share.
