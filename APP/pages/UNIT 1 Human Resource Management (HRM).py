        Human Resource Management (HRM) consists of HRM practices designed to maximize employee engagement, productivity, and job satisfaction. HRM practices include:
        - **Job Analysis and Design** (UNIT 2): Covers tasks, skills, jobs, job evaluation, and skill requirements for each job.
        - **HR Planning** (UNIT 3): Starts with data collection to show how to forecast employee availability using the transition matrix.
        - **Employee Performance Evaluation** (UNIT 4): Addresses the intensive margin.
        - **Recruitment** (UNIT 5): Discusses employment, asymmetric information, adverse selection, and how to mitage it.
        - **On-the-Job Training** (UNIT 6): Presents training as a way to reduce the skill gap of incumbent workers and uses the difference-in-differences method to measure training impacts.
        - **Compensation** (UNIT 7): Explores pay-for-performance models and employee-ownership options.
        - **Career Development** (UNIT 8): Introduces the tournament model as a framework for employee growth and progression.

    Any firm, regardless of its size, structure, or legal form of ownership, 
    produces **output** (a good or a service) and performs **economic activities** 
    necessary for that production. Firms are classified into sectors (industries) based on the output 
    they produce and the economic activities they perform. There are standard classifications for 
    economic activities, such as **NACE Rev. 2, the European Classification of Economic Activities**.

    These economic activities are carried out by both employees and technology.
    Consequently, a firm's decisions on which technologies to adopt and which jobs to post
    in the labor market will depend on the specific economic activities required.
        
    Just as firms are classified into industries based on the output
    they produce and associated economic activities, jobs are classified into
    occupations depending on the tasks they entail. Same as for economic activities, 
    there are standard classifications for occupations, 
    such as **ISCO (International Standard Classification 
    of Occupations)**. 
        
    It is important to note that a job is not the same as an occupation. 
    Occupations are standardized, while jobs are more
    flexible as they are designed by firms.
