        Human resource management (HRM) takes on the organization and motivation of employees by implementing HRM practices
        such as job analysis and design, recruitment, HR planning, performance evaluation, training, compensation, 
        and career development. HRM is implemented at the firm level.

        
        The essense of any firm, regardless of its size or legal form of ownership, depends on two important decisions:
        - **What output (good or service) to produce**
        - **How to produce it**
        
        The second decision involves in turn the following specific decisions:
        - What activities the firm needs to complete to produce the output.
        - How to allocate these activities into the factors of production (labor and technology)

        The activities allocated to labor (employees) are called **work activities** and HRM organizes and motivates
        employees to perform **work activities** efficiently and effectively.

        Firms are classified into industries depending on the output they produce and jobs are classified into occupations depending on
        the work activities they entail. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) provides a standard classification
        of firms into industries and the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) provides
        a standard classification of jobs into occupations.
