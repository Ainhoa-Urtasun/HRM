        We refer to the activities that labor (employees) must complete as **work activities**. As part of the **how to produce it** decision, firms also decide how 
        to group these **work activities** into jobs or occupations and how many employees are needed for each occupation. As firms are classified into industries 
        depending on the output they produce, employees are classified into occupations depending on the work activities they perform.

        and the [Standard Occupational Classification (SOC)](https://www.bls.gov/soc/2018/major_groups.htm) classifies employees into occupations.

        Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) is a measure of a company's profitability

        from the company's core business operations, providing insight into how effectively 
        the company is being managed and its ability to generate operating profits. 
        EBIT is often used to compare the performance of companies within the same industry,
