    Any firm, regardless of its size, structure, or legal form of ownership, 
    produces an output (good or service) and performs **economic activities** 
    to achieve this. Firms are classified into sectors (industries) based on the output 
    they produce and the economic activities they perform. 

    To perform these economic activities, firms decide which technologies to adopt
    and which jobs to post in the labor market.
    
    A job consists of a bundle of tasks, and just as firms are classified into sectors (industries), 
    jobs are classified into occupations based on the tasks they entail. 

    There are standard classifications for firms into sectors, 
    such as NACE rev. 2, the European Classification of Economic Activities.
    There are also standard classificationf for jobs into occupations, 
    such as ISCO that stands for International Standard Classification 
    of Occupations.
