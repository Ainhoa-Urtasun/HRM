    The output elasticities of each type of job ($e_1$, $e_2$, $e_3$) represent the contribution of each job type to the overall performance of the firm. 
    These elasticities measure how much output changes in response to a 1% change in the number of employees in each job type, holding other factors constant. 
    Jobs with higher output elasticities contribute more to the firm's production. 

    Output elasticities are closely linked to labor productivity because they reflect how effectively labor in each job type is transformed into output. 
    Therefore, they are also related to the effort exerted by employees, as more effort can increase the productivity of labor in each job, amplifying its contribution to the firmâ€™s success.
