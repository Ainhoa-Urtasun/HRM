        '''Firms make two important decisions, **what to produce** and **how to produce it**. The **what to produce** decision refers to the output (good or service).
        The **how to produce it** decision, on the other hand, refers to the activities to be performed and who, labor or technology, performs these activities. 
        We refer to the activities that labor (employees) must complete as **work activities**. As part of the **how to produce it** decision, firms also decide how 
        to group these **work activities** into jobs or occupations and how many employees are needed for each occupation. As firms are classified into industries 
        depending on the output they produce, employees are classified into occupations depending on the work activities they perform. 
        [The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)](https://www.census.gov/naics/) classifies firms into industries depending on the type of output they produce
        and the [Standard Occupational Classification (SOC)](https://www.bls.gov/soc/2018/major_groups.htm) classifies employees into occupations. 
        To streamline our analysis, this course focuses on three occupations.'''
