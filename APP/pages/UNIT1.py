    Any firm, regardless of its size, structure, or legal form of ownership, 
    produces an output (good or service) and engages in **economic activities** 
    to achieve this. Firms are classified into sectors (industries) based on the output 
    they produce and the associated economic activities. 

    To execute these economic activities, firms decide which technologies to adopt
    and which jobs to post in the labor market.
    
    A job consists of a bundle of tasks and just as firms are classified into sectors (industries), 
    jobs are classified into occupations based on the tasks they entail. 
    
    There are standard classifications for firms into sectors, 
    such as NACE (Nomenclature of Economic Activities), and for jobs into occupations, 
    such as ISCO (International Standard Classification of Occupations).
