    Any firm, regardless of its size, structure, or legal form of ownership, 
    produces an output (good or service) and engages in **economic activities** 
    to achieve this. Firms are classified into sectors (industries) based on the output 
    they produce and the associated economic activities. 

    To execute these economic activities, firms decide which technologies to adopt
    and which jobs to post in the labor market.
    
     A job consists of a bundle of tasks, and just as firms are classified into sectors (industries), 
     jobs are classified into occupations based on the tasks they entail. 
     A job is not the same as an occupationâ€”an occupation is more general. Occupations are standardized, 
     while jobs are more flexible because they are defined by firms. Firms decide which jobs to post.
    
    There are standard classifications for firms into sectors, 
    such as [NACE rev.2](https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/tools/skills-intelligence/sectors?sector=05), 
    and for jobs into occupations, 
    such as [ISCO-08](https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/tools/skills-intelligence/occupations?occupation=4.41).

    NACE is the European Classification of Economic Activities and ISCO stands for International Standard Classification 
    of Occupations.
