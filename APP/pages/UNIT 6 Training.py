        The skill profile of a person represents their human capital, which is the result of a 
        long-term investment in skills, education, and experience. 
        Human capital refers to the knowledge, abilities, and competencies that individuals 
        bring to the workforce, contributing to productivity and economic value.
        
        - **General human capital** includes skills and knowledge that are transferable 
        across different firms or industries. Examples include literacy, numeracy, problem-solving, 
        and general management skills. Because these skills are valuable to many employers, 
        individuals with high general human capital have greater mobility in the labor market.
        
        - **Specific human capital refers to skills and knowledge that are valuable only 
        to a particular firm or job. Examples include mastery of proprietary processes, 
        familiarity with unique organizational structures,
        or job-specific technical expertise. These skills increase productivity within the specific 
        firm but are less transferable to other employers.
        
        So, the primary difference between general and specific human capital lies in transferability: 
        General human capital is portable and valued universally in the labor market. 
        Specific human capital has limited applicability outside the organization or context where it was developed.
        Employers often invest more in training related to specific human capital, while individuals bear the cost of acquiring general human capital, as it enhances their overall employability and earning potential.

        Firms have two options for skill development (or upskilling): 
        
        1. Hiring new employees
        2. Training incumbent employees
        
        Upskilling may be necesary to adopt new technologies, such as 
        robots and artificial intelligence (AI).

        **skill profile** of employee $i$. Remember, $s_{(k)}$ is derived from 
        the job evaluation process.
        
        On-the-job training aims to provide employees with the 
        skills and competencies needed to complete tasks more efficiently. In other words,     
        on-the-job training aims to reduce the skill gap $g_i$.
        By minimizing $g_i$, the cost of effort for the employee decreases, which can
        positively impact their motivation.

        compared to a similar group that did not receive the training (non-trained group). 

        The Difference-in-Differences (DiD) method achieves this by making two key comparisons:
        
        - **Before and after training**: Training occurs at time 0, so âˆ’1 represents the period before training, and +1 represents the period after training.
        - **Trained versus non-trained employees**: $g^{trained}$ denotes the average skill gap of employees who received training,
        while $g^{non-trained}$ denotes the average skill gap of employees who did not.

        By combining these two comparisons, the DiD method helps estimate the causal impact of training on reducing the skill gap. 
        Note: The method is valid if the **parallel trends assumption** holdsâ€”that is, if the trained and non-trained groups 
        would have followed similar skill gap trends in the absence of training.
