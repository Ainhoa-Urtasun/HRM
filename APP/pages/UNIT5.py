        In recruiting, **asymmetric information** arises because job candidates 
        know more about their skills than the firm does. This can lead to **adverse selection**, 
        where the firm may end up hiring less qualified candidates due to this information gap. 
        Hereâ€™s how adverse selection occurs: to attract a pool of candidates, 
        the firm posts a job ad specifying the tasks, required skills, credentials, 
        and salary for the role. Due to limited information about each candidateâ€™s true abilities, 
        the employer offers an average salary for the position. 
        This attracts candidates who meet the listed credentials, but these credentials, 
        while signaling a certain level of qualification, do not fully reveal each candidate's suitability.
    
        However, this average salary might be too low for the 'good' candidates 
        while still appealing to 'wrong' ones, 
        resulting in adverse selection where primarily 'wrong' candidates apply.

        Consider the following cost of effort for each job candidate:

            C(e_i) = d(s_{(k)},s_i)e_i^2 \\[10pt]

            '''

    st.write(
        '''
        where $e_i$ represents the effort job candidate $i$ would exert if hired; $d(s_{(k)},s_i)$ is the Euclidean distance 
        between $s_{(k)}$, the vector of skill norms required by the job job candidate $i$ would have to perform if hired, and the 
        vector of skills that job candidate $i$ actually possesses. The greater the distance, the higher the 
        cost of effort for the job candidate $i$. Remember, the vector of skill norms is derived from 
        the job evaluation process.
        
        Assuming two job candidates, 1 and 2, where $d_1 = 10$ and $d_2 = 90$, 
        this indicates a good-matching candidate and a poor-matching candidate, respectively. 
        The cost of effort for the high-skill candidate is:

    st.latex(r"C(e_1) = e_1^2")
    st.write(
        '''
        This lower cost reflects that the high-skill candidate possesses the necessary skill abundantly, 
        making effort less costly for them.

        For a low-skill candidate, the cost of effort is:
        '''
    )
    
    st.latex(r"C(e_2) = 100 e_2^2")

    st.write(
        '''
        This higher cost implies that it would be more expensive for the low-skill candidate to 
        exert the same level of effort as the high-skill candidate.
        
        The company offers a monthly salary of â‚¬10,000, expecting a target effort level of $e^* = 100$.
        
        Under this salary and effort expectation, a high-skill candidate is willing to exert the 
        required effort.
        In contrast, a low-skill candidate would face a prohibitive cost
        and thus would not apply.
