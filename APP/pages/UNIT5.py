    Any firm, regardless of its size, structure, or legal form of ownership, 
    produces an output (good or service) and performs **economic activities** 
    to achieve this. Firms are classified into sectors (industries) based on the output 
    they produce and the economic activities they perform. 

    To perform these economic activities, firms decide which technologies to adopt
    and which jobs to post in the labor market.
    
    A job consists of a bundle of tasks, and just as firms are classified into sectors (industries), 
    jobs are classified into occupations based on the tasks they entail. 

    There are standard classifications for firms into sectors, 
    such as NACE rev. 2, the European Classification of Economic Activities.
    There are also standard classificationf for jobs into occupations, 
    such as ISCO that stands for International Standard Classification 
    of Occupations.

        In recruiting, **asymmetric information** arises because job candidates 
        know more about their skills than the firm does. This can lead to **adverse selection**, 
        where the firm may end up hiring less qualified candidates due to this information gap. 
        Hereâ€™s how adverse selection occurs: to attract a pool of candidates, 
        the firm posts a job ad specifying the tasks, required skills, credentials, 
        and salary for the role. Due to limited information about each candidateâ€™s true abilities, 
        the employer offers an average salary for the position. 
        This attracts candidates who meet the listed credentials, but these credentials, 
        while signaling a certain level of qualification, do not fully reveal each candidate's suitability.
    
        However, this average salary might be too low for the 'good' candidates 
        while still appealing to 'wrong' ones, 
        resulting in adverse selection where primarily 'wrong' candidates apply.

        between $s_{(k)}$, the vector of skill norms required by the job job candidate $i$ would have to perform if hired, and the 
        vector of skills that job candidate $i$ actually possesses. The value of $d$ measures the matching between 
        the job candidate and the job they are supposed to perform if hired.
        Well-matched job candidates will show a low $d$ whereas poorly-matched job candidates will show a high $d$.The greater the distance, the higher the 
        cost of effort for the job candidate $i$. Remember, the vector of skill norms is derived from 
        the job evaluation process.

        To attract well-matched job candidates, the firm can specify in the job posting both the effort required and the 
        corresponding salary that compensates well-matched job candidates. This approach will deter poorly-matched job candidates, as
        their high cost of effort would require a significantly higher salary to make the job worthwhile.
