        A **skill**, denoted as $s_i$, is an ability or competence that an individual possesses. Employees use their skills to effectively perform 
        tasks. Skills themselves do not directly produce output; rather, they enable the completion of tasks. 
        There are many classifications of skills. For simplicty, we focus only on the 4 
        most requested transversal skills and competences in online job ads in the EU27 in 2023
        [Skills intelligence](https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/tools/skills-intelligence):

        - $s_1$ Demonstrating willingness to learn
        - $s_2$ Collaborating in teams and networks
        - $s_3$ Working efficiently
        - $s_4$ Taking a proactive approach
        
        A **task**, denoted as $t_j$, is an action performed by an employee that results in a specific output.
        For simplicity, we assume any economic activity can be completed by carrying out the 5 core tasks listed in

        A **job**, denoted as $J_k$, is a bundle of tasks ($t_1$: intellectual, $t_2$: physical,
        $t_3$: social, $t_4$: use of methods, and $t_5$: use of technology). To carry out each task,
        employees need to possess 
        multiple skills ($s_1$: demostrating willigness to learn, $s_2$: maintaining a postive attitude, 
        $s_3$: taking a proactive approach, and $s_4$: working efficiently):
        - $J_1$ Other managers

        **Job evaluation** assesses the relative worth of jobs within a firm, helping in job design,

        The **task-skill matrix** is a tool for job evaluation, where each column corresponds
