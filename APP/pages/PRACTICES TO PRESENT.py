        In this course, students will complete **25 Practices**, each contributing 1% to their final grade. 
        These practices are divided into two main types and are completed regularly during class sessions:
        
        - **Test & Quiz Practices**: Exam-like questions for each unit.
        - **Interactive Practices**: Hands-on tasks completed through an app, with students presenting their findings 
          out loud to enhance their communication skills. Students can work individually or in pairs.

        Students will present the **interactive practices** in two stages:
        - **Mid-Semester Presentations**: Practices 3, 6, 9, and 12.
        - **End-of-Semester Presentations**: Practices 15, 18, 21, and 24.

        Practice 25, at the end of the semester, will evaluate the **cohesiveness** and **connection** between all the interactive practices presented. This ensures students integrate their learnings effectively and present a coherent narrative.

        The table below summarizes the practices by unit and type:
