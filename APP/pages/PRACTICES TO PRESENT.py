    In this course, students will complete **25 Practices**, each contributing 1% to their final grade. 
    These practices are divided into two types:

    - *Test and Quiz Practices*: exam-like questions for each unit 
    - *Interactive Practices*: selecting a firm and creating visuals through an app. Students will 
      also present their findings out loud, enhancing their communication skills.
