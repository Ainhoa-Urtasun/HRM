        Performance evaluation assesses how well employees perform within the firm. 
        This can be done in two ways:
        - **On average**
        - **Individually**, which is challenging but also more meaningful 
        
        Performance evaluation also distinguishes between:
        - **The extensive margin** addresses employee participation in tasks. Examples of extensive margin
        performance evaluation measures include attendance and absenteeism
        - **The intensive margin** focuses on the level of effort and productivity during tasks, examining
        how employees perform while working

        A common average performance metric for the intensive margin is **labor productivity**:

        This first derivative shows the marginal cost of effort. Since $g_i>0$, 
        the marginal cost of effort increases linearly with $e_i$.

        The second derivative with respect to $e_i$ is:

    st.write(

        Since $g_i>0$, the second derivative is positive, which means that the cost function
        $C(e_i)$ is convex, or "concave-up". This convexity indicates that the cost of effort 
        increases at an increasing rate as effort $e_i$ rises.
    
        **Jensen's inequality** tells us that for a convex function such as $C(e_i)$, the expected cost of 
        effort is at least the cost of the expected effort. Mathematically:

    st.write(
        '''
        This inequality implies that, due to the convex nature of $C(e_i)$, 
        any variability in effort will lead to a higher average cost compared to a 
        scenario where effort is consistent. Thus, encouraging consistent effort across employees 
        minimizes the cost impact due to the convexity of the function.
