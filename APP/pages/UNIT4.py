        Performance evaluation refers to assessing how well employees perform within the firm. 
        Performance can be evaluated on average or for each specific employee, with the latter being more challenging 
        but also more meaningful.

        A typical average performance metric is labor productivity.

        A more meaningful yet challenging approach to performance evaluation is assessing 
        the effort each employee exerts. Effort here is not just working hours; it reflects 
        the employee's willingness to make meaningful contributions to the firm. This includes 
        not only hours worked but also the skills and motivation required to perform tasks effectively.

        When employee effort is assessed properly, it allows the firm to understand each employee's 
        contribution to its overall value and motivates them to improve their performance.

        Next, we present several alternative metrics for evaluating employee effort.

        We can analyze its properties by calculating its derivatives. Taking the first derivative with

        C'(e_i) = \frac{d}{de_i} \left[(100 - S_i)e_i^2\right] = 2(100 - S_i)e_i
        '''
    )

    st.write(
        '''
        This first derivative shows the marginal cost of effort. Since $(100 - S_i)$ is a positive constant, 
        the marginal cost of effort increases linearly with $e_i$.

        The second derivative with respect to $e_i$ is:
        '''
    )

    st.latex(
        r'''
        C''(e_i) = \frac{d^2}{de_i^2} \left[(100 - S_i)e_i^2\right] = 2(100 - S_i)
        '''
    )

    st.write(
        '''
        Since $2(100 - S_i) > 0$, the second derivative is positive, which means that the cost function
        $C(e_i)$ is convex, or "concave-up". This convexity indicates that the cost of effort 
        increases at an increasing rate as effort $e_i$ rises.
    
        Jensen's inequality tells us that for a convex function such as $C(e_i)$, the expected cost of 
        effort is at least the cost of the expected effort. Mathematically:
        '''
    )

    st.latex(
        r'''
        E[C(e_i)] \geq C(E[e_i])
        '''
    )

    st.write(
        '''
        This inequality implies that, due to the convex nature of $C(e_i)$, 
        any variability in effort will lead to a higher average cost compared to a 
        scenario where effort is consistent. Thus, encouraging consistent effort across employees 
        minimizes the cost impact due to the convexity of the function.
