        Performance evaluation refers to assessing how well employees perform within the firm.

        In recruiting, **asymmetric information** arises because job candidates 
        know more about their skills than the firm does. This can lead to **adverse selection**, 
        where the firm may end up hiring less qualified candidates due to this information gap. 
        Hereâ€™s how adverse selection occurs: to attract a pool of candidates, 
        the firm posts a job ad specifying the tasks, required skills, credentials, 
        and salary for the role. Due to limited information about each candidateâ€™s true abilities, 
        the employer offers an average salary for the position. 
        This attracts candidates who meet the listed credentials, but these credentials, 
        while signaling a certain level of qualification, do not fully reveal each candidate's suitability.
    
        However, this average salary might be too low for the 'good' candidates 
        while still appealing to 'wrong' ones, 
        resulting in adverse selection where primarily 'wrong' candidates apply.
