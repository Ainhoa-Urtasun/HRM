        Hiring $h$ employees is not an immediate process, but it results from several steps: 
        1. The firm has a number of job vacancies (same as job openings), representing jobs that need to be filled: $v$
        2. To attract and recruit a pool of job candidates, the firm post the job vacancies. Today, online job postings are very common. 
        The number of job postings (same as job advertisements)
        may differ from the number of job vacancies, but for simplicity, we assume they are the same
        3. Finally, the firm selects or hires a number of job candidates: $h$

        A firm's **vacancy yield** measures the efficiency of converting job vacancies into hires. It is the ratio of hires $h$ 
        to job vacancies $v$. It indicates how many times hires are made per job vacancy. A higher vacancy yield suggests the firm
        is more effective in filling open positions, while a lower yield might indicate challenges in attracting or selecting 
        suitable candidates.

        Occupational vacancy rates in the labor market indicate a higher demand for workers in that occupation, suggesting better job opportunities
        and potential for growth.

        Job candidates typically have more knowledge about their own skills, 
        abilities, and work ethic than the hiring firm. This imbalance, known as **asymmetric information**, 
        can lead to inefficiencies. In extreme cases, it results in **adverse selection**, 
        where the firm unintentionally attracts and hires less qualified candidates, 
        creating a workforce less capable than intended.
        
        To address these issues, economics introduces the concepts of **screening** and **signaling**, 
        which help mitigate the inefficiencies caused by asymmetric information.
        
        - **Screening**: This strategy is used by the less informed party (the employer) to gather information 
        and distinguish between different types of candidates. Employers use tools like 
        well-crafted job advertisements, assessments, and interviews to identify the most qualified applicants.
        - **Signaling**: This strategy is employed by the more informed party (the employee) 
        to communicate their abilities to the employer. For instance, earning a degree from a 
        prestigious institution signals competence. Signaling is effective when the cost of obtaining 
        the signal (e.g., education) is high and varies between highly skilled and less skilled candidates. 
        It works if acquiring the signal is less costly for highly skilled candidates.

        If screening and signaling fail, firms may end up hiring less desirable candidates. 
        For example, an employer offering an average salary due to a luck of trust in signalling
        may attract less qualified applicants who cannot secure find better opportunities, 
        while deterring top talent with access to superior offers. In this line,
        if a university degree fails to differentiate those willing to learn from those who are not, 
        signaling may lose its effectiveness.

        A **probationary period** is a specified time frame at the beginning of employment 
        during which the employer evaluates the new hireâ€™s performance, suitability for the job, 
        and alignment with company expectations. 
        
        Working conditions during this period are less favorable. Employees might have reduced
        job security, as termination during this time typically requires less 
        formal procedures. Access to certain benefits, such as health
        insurance or retirement plans, might also be limited. 
        
        The length of a probationary period usually ranges from 1 to 6 months, 
        depending on the employer and local labor laws. Upon successful completion, 
        the employee is usually granted full employment status and benefits.

        Probationary periods maybe mentioned in job advertisements. If disclosed, 
        the ad might include a statement like: 
        *"This position includes a 3-month probationary period."* Otherwise, details are often 
        provided during later stages of the hiring process or in the employment contract.

        Same as for incumbent employees, consider the following **cost of effort** for ta job candidate:
        '''
    )

    st.latex(
            r'''
            C(e_i) = g_i e_i^2 \\[10pt]
            '''
        )

    st.write(
        '''
        where:
        - $e_i$ represents the effort or work ethic exerted by employee $i$, with $e_i \geq 0$
        - $g_i$ is the **skill gap** of employee $i$, with $g_i \geq 0$. The greater their skill gap, the higher the 
        cost of effort for employee $i$. Well-matched job candidates will have 
        a low skill gap $g_i$ whereas poorly-matched job candidates will have a high skill gap $g_i$. 
        
        The **skill gap** reflects the distance between a candidate's skills and the job skill requirements.
        The greater this gap, the higher the cost of effort for the job candidate $i$ to perform the job effectively. 
        Remember, $s_{(k)}$ is derived from the job evaluation process.
        
        Asymmetric information exists because employees are awared of their own skill gap, while employers only know
        the job skill requirements. However, since job candidates behave according to their cost of effort function,
        firms might reduce this asymmetry by setting a challenging **probationary period**. 
        
        During the probationary period, candidates are expected to exert a high level of effort and show
        high work ethic standards. For poorly matched candidates with a high skill gap, the cost of effort 
        during this period will likely outweigh the benefits, deterring them from applying or remaining in the role. 
        Conversely, well-matched candidates with a low skill gap are more likely to meet the expectations 
        and proceed successfully.
        
        After the probationary period, working conditions, including salary and job responsibilities, are adjusted to 
        reflect the candidateâ€™s proven abilities. This ensures that well-matched candidates are rewarded appropriately, 
        while less suitable candidates are filtered out effectively.
