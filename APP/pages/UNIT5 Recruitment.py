        In recruiting, **asymmetric information** arises because job candidates 
        know more about their skills than the firm does. This can lead to **adverse selection**, 
        where the firm may end up hiring less qualified candidates due to this information gap. 
        Hereâ€™s how adverse selection occurs: to attract a pool of candidates, 
        the firm posts a job ad specifying the tasks, required skills, credentials, 
        and salary for the role. Due to limited information about each candidateâ€™s true abilities, 
        the employer offers an average salary for the position. 
        This attracts candidates who meet the listed credentials, but these credentials, 
        while signaling a certain level of qualification, do not fully reveal each candidate's suitability.
    
        However, this average salary might be too low for the 'good' candidates 
        while still appealing to 'wrong' ones, 
        resulting in adverse selection where primarily 'wrong' candidates apply.

        Consider the following **cost of effort** for the job candidate:

    )

    st.latex(
            r'''
            C(e_i) = g_i e_i^2 \\[10pt]
            '''
        )

    st.write(
        '''
        where $e_i$ represents the effort job candidate $i$ would exert if hired; 
        $g_i$ is the **skill gap** of job candidate $i$ calculated as the Euclidean distance 
        between $s_{(k)}$, the **skill requirements** for the job, and $s_i$, the 
        **skill profile** of job candidate $i$. Well-matched job candidates will show 
        a low skill gap $g_i$ whereas poorly-matched job candidates will show a high skill gap $g_i$. 
        The greater the distance, the higher the 
        cost of effort for the job candidate $i$. Remember, $s_{(k)}$ is derived from 
        the job evaluation process.

        To attract well-matched job candidates, the firm can specify in the job posting both the required 
        level of effort and the corresponding salary, which compensates well-matched candidates 
        but not poorly-matched ones. This approach will deter poorly-matched candidates, 
        as their high cost of effort would require a significantly higher salary to make the job worthwhile. 
        By setting these conditionsâ€”a high level of required effort at a relatively low salaryâ€”during a probation period, 
        the company can assess the candidateâ€™s fit for the role and decide whether to offer a long-term job contract.
