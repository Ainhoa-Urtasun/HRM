        In recruiting, **asymmetric information** arises because job candidates 
        know more about their skills than the firm does. This can lead to **adverse selection**, 
        where the firm may end up hiring less qualified candidates due to this information gap. 
        Hereâ€™s how adverse selection occurs: to attract a pool of candidates, 
        the firm posts a job ad specifying the tasks, required skills, credentials, 
        and salary for the role. Due to limited information about each candidateâ€™s true abilities, 
        the employer may set a moderate salary for the position. 
        This job posting will attract candidates who meet the listed credentials and are satisfied with the
        offered salary. The credentials, while signaling a certain level of qualification, 
        do not fully reveal each candidate's suitability.
    
        If the salary offered in the job ad is too low for the 'good' candidates but sufficient for 'less qualified'
        candidates, this will resulting in adverse selection, where primarily less suitable candidates apply.

        Same as for incumbent employees, we consider the following **cost of effort** for the job candidate:

    st.write(

        where:
        - $e_i$ represents the effort exerted by employee $i$, with $e_i \geq 0$
        - $g_i$ is the **skill gap** of employee $i$, with $g_i \geq 0$. The greater their skill gap, the higher the 
        cost of effort for employee $i$. Well-matched job candidates will show 
        a low skill gap $g_i$ whereas poorly-matched job candidates will show a high skill gap $g_i$. 
        The greater the distance, the higher the 
        cost of effort for the job candidate $i$. Remember, $s_{(k)}$ is derived from 
        the job evaluation process.
        
        To mitigate adverse selection when recruiting and attract 
        well-matched job candidates, the firm can specify in the job posting not only the credentials        
        but also the required skills, tasks, level of effort, and a salary that compensates 
        well-matched candidates but not poorly-matched ones. This approach will deter poorly-matched candidates, 
        as their high cost of effort would require a significantly higher salary to make the job worthwhile. 
        By setting these conditionsâ€”a high level of required effort at a relatively low salaryâ€”during a probation period, 
        the company can assess the candidateâ€™s fit for the role and decide whether to offer a long-term job contract.
